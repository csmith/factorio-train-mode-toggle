# Train mode toggle

Very simple [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/) mod that adds a keyboard
shortcut to toggle the mode (automatic or manual) of the train the player is
riding.

To use, simply press 'j' (by default, configurable in settings) while
inside a train locomotive or carriage, and the mode will be flipped
(i.e., automatic trains will switch to manual, manual trains will
be switched to automatic).

The [FARL](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/Choumiko/FARL) and
[Honk](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/GotLag/Honk) mods have similar
functionality included with their other functions.
